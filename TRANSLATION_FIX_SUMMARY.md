# Translation Fix Summary

## Problem
When users requested translation of question papers, the AI was only translating questions but not the headers (course names, examination types, instructions, etc.).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Translation Instructions
Updated the system instructions in `route.js` to explicitly specify which header fields need translation:

**Headers to Translate:**
- `courseName` (course/subject names)
- `examinationType` ("Examination", "Test", "Quiz", etc.)
- `semesterYear` (text parts like "First Year", "Second Semester")
- `subjectName` (subject names)
- `time` ("3 hours", "2 hours 30 minutes", etc.)
- `notes` (instruction text like "Answer all questions")
- `subjectCode` (if it contains descriptive text)

**Headers NOT to Translate:**
- `totalMarks` (keep numbers unchanged)
- Style classes
- Technical field names

### 2. Clear Examples Added
Added comprehensive examples showing:
- Before and after translation for headers
- Before and after translation for questions
- What to preserve vs what to translate

### 3. Step-by-Step Process
Made the translation process explicit:
1. Copy the source document
2. Translate ALL user-visible text (headers AND questions)
3. Preserve structural elements
4. Add translated copy to content array

### 4. Priority Emphasis
Added explicit reminder that headers are equally important as questions since users need course information, exam instructions, and time limits in their target language.

## Expected Result
Now when users request translation (e.g., "translate to French", "create Spanish version"), the AI will translate:

✅ **Headers**: Course names, exam types, instructions, time descriptions
✅ **Questions**: All question text and sub-question text
✅ **Preserve**: Numbers, indexes, styles, technical codes

## Example Usage
User says: "Translate this to French"

**Before (Bug):**
- Headers: "Computer Science", "Final Examination" (NOT translated)
- Questions: "Qu'est-ce qu'un algorithme?" (translated)

**After (Fixed):**
- Headers: "Informatique", "Examen Final" (translated)
- Questions: "Qu'est-ce qu'un algorithme?" (translated)

## Files Modified
- `src/app/api/generateai/route.js` - Enhanced translation instructions
- Added test files to demonstrate correct behavior

The fix ensures complete document translation while maintaining the proper structure and validation requirements.
